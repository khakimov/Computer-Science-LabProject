 *      Simple Error Manager create in order
 *      to manage all the possible error that
 *      could be generated while we're used the
 *      Matrix Library.
 *      Everything works using a specific errno global
 *      value whose aim was to take trace of the last error
 *      that was tracked during the execution.
